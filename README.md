Hamming Code Simulation
========

This project simulates the Hamming Code principle in that it can generate, check, and correct a 16 bit hexadecimal value. 


##Features
- Generate 21 bits from a 16 bit value
- Revert a 21 bit value back to the 16 bit original
- Control the validity of the checkbits in a 21 bit value
- In case of error, corrects 1 error bit. 


##Get Started
These instructions will download the source files, compile the code, and get you started.
